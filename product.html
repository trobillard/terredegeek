		<h2>Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020) review: Big steps to a bright future</h2>
		<a href="item1.html"><img src="1.jpg"></a>
		<p>	Yes, it really is only a few months since the last MacBook Air hit the streets. But while this new end-of-2020 model looks and feels the same as the one from 		earlier in the year, what's inside is quite different.<br>
			That's because the MacBook Air now runs exclusively on Apple's own processors, dubbed Apple Silicon. The Apple M1 chip inside shares more in common – actually a lot in common – with Apple's A-Series iPhone and iPad chips than any Intel processor. It's the same M1 that's now available in the Mac mini range as well as the 13-inch MacBook Pro (although there's still an Intel model available of the latter for now).<br>
			Apple Silicon is here: What does the Apple M1 mean for your next Mac?<br>
			The transition to Apple Silicon follows on from 15 years of Macs using Intel processors and, while we're not sure what's happening at the top-end of the range, it's safe to say that all low-to-mid-level Macs will be running Apple Silicon by the end of 2021. So what difference does it make and is now the right time to jump in?<br>

			Design<br>
			Dimensions: 304 x 212mm / 41-161mm thick / Weight: 1.29kg<br>
			Ports: 2x USB-C (USB 4) / Thunderbolt 3, 1x 3.5mm jack<br>
			Finish options: Gold, Space Grey, Silver<br>
			As with the 2019 and early 2020 models, the external design of the first M1 Macbook Air is the same. We've remarked elsewhere how surprised we are that Apple didn't take the opportunity to create a radical new Mac with the change to its own processor design. After all, we could have had a replacement for the old MacBook, which was sort of like a sub-MacBook Air.<br><br>

			<img src="2.jpg">
			<br>Once again there are two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports – which can sometimes limit you a little, but in reality it's increasingly a rarity. The notable thing here is that they support the new USB 4 standard. The 3.5mm headphone jack remains but it's surely now on borrowed time on the Mac.<br>
			The keyboard is the same again as the early 2020 MacBook Air, but that keyboard brought serious improvement over earlier generations, with the introduction of the Magic Keyboard with an older-style scissor mechanism. It's very comfortable to type on for long periods and has much better travel than older 'butterfly' MacBook Pro keyboards. While many lauded the Magic Keyboard as a revelation, the fact is you should expect a fantastic keyboard to be part of a laptop like this. It's a minimum requirement.<br>

			
			Touch ID is in the top right corner of the keyboard, meaning quick and easy login with a fingerprint, but we really hope that Face ID will come to the Mac in 2021. You've been able to use your face to log into Windows 10 since 2016, so Apple is trailing behind here – in particular as the technology already exists in its phones.<br>

			Display<br>
			13.3-inch Retina Display, 2650 x 1600 resolution<br>
			Can drive up to one 6K external display<br>
			True Tone support, P3 wide colour<br>
			Again you get the well-known 13.3-inch Retina display, giving you the same resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels as the 2019 and early 2020 versions. True Tone ensures the display adapts to your environment, while there's also support for the P3 wide colour gamut – which is new for the Air this time around.<br>
			The Air's display no longer has a huge bezel, but it does feel like Apple needs to match some of the PC designs coming out with near-borderless displays, which aren't even that new – the Dell XPS 13 has had a super-thin bezel for half a decade now. We've said that bezel design needs to be refined for other Macs, too, particularly the iMac, and perhaps we will see some movement here over the next year or so.<br><br>

			<img src="3.jpg">
			<br>We found there was no problem driving our external 4K display via USB-C, but you can only connect a single 4K, 5K or 6K display at 60Hz (yes, you can drive Apple's Pro Display XDR if you really want to – wouldn't that be a dream?). The recent Intel version was capable of driving two 4K displays, or a single 5K display or a single 6K display over Thunderbolt, so the M1 is a rare and slight downgrade in that regard which will be noticed by some.<br>
			When we talked about the changes we wanted to see from Apple Silicon Macs, one of them was the hope that the Mac would support touch. Apple seems very set against touch for the Mac – and is persisting with the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro – yet tells us that an iPad is a computer and that it can do anything. As a differentiator between product lines, it makes sense.<br>
			But there's now (more than) a generation of kids who are totally used to touch and are pretty bemused they can't touch a laptop's screen, especially if they've done it with Windows 10, iPads and smartphones. Every time we're using a Mac, someone in our family tries to touch the screen to flick through pictures or webpages – and that has to say something about what should happen with the Mac. Of course, Apple will have been thinking about this, but our opinion is that a change needs to happen sooner rather than later.<br>
			Performance and battery life<br>
			Apple M1 processor (3GHz; 8-core - 4 perform­ance and 4 efficiency cores)<br>
			7 or 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine<br>
			256/512GB storage (up to 1TB, 2TB)<br>
			8GB RAM (upgradeable to 16GB)<br>
			Battery cited at 15 hours<br>
			There are two versions of the Air available: one with seven-core graphics (more on that shortly) and a 256GB SSD; another with eight-core graphics and 512GB of storage. You can upgrade the storage in either version to a maximum of 2TB (an eye-watering upgrade in terms of cost though).<br><br>
			
			<img src="4.jpg">
			<br>Both versions of the Air have 8GB of RAM as standard (upgradeable to 16GB, which is the limit of what Apple Silicon can currently support, it seems). The two options also house identical CPUs – the eight-core Apple M1 with CPU cores based on the latest ARM design. And they don't use fans either – so are silent in operation.<br>
			The M1 shares a huge amount with Apple's A-Series processors and, more specifically, the A14 Bionic found in the iPhone 12 and 2020 iPad Air. Like that chip, the M1 is based on TSMC's 5nm manufacturing process – which means it's super-efficient. No non-Apple computer yet has a chip based on that process. Intel is still floundering with getting to 7nm, while Qualcomm hasn't yet announced PC silicon based on 5nm.<br>

			Like the A14 Bionic there are four performance cores and four cores designed for power efficiency. This results in serious performance. Like others, we have been blown away by the raw capability on show here, because everything you expect to take time – like an installation or processing of video – happens so quickly. One negative, however, is that unlike the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip, performance will throttle over time to keep things cool and that's why pros will still want to go with the Pro.<br><br>

			<img src="5.jpg">
			<br>We don't normally do benchmarks on Pocket-lint (unless it's for a gaming laptop or rig), but as this is the first time a chip has made its way into the wild it makes sense for a quick comparison. Our Geekbench 5 benchmark results show simply steaming performance (1731 single-core, 7475 multi-core score). A simple look at the Mac charts for Geekbench 5 shows you that on single-core performance the M1 is faster than any Mac Pro. And on multi-core performance the new M1 systems fall only behind the Intel Xeon Macs (Mac Pro and iMac Pro) and the 2019/2020 iMacs with Intel's high-end Core Core i7-10700K and i9-9900K (check out our 2020 iMac review).<br>

			Raw performance is certainly not an issue then. And the efficiency of the ARM-based design has another benefit we had expected – longer battery life. Apple cites up to 18 hours video playback and 15 hours using the web. We found you could eke the battery out to last around 11 hours, but 10 is more common for serious use with video calls and lots of apps open and working in the background – which is still a great innings when many Windows machines will score around seven hours.<br>

			A note about the graphics. As we mentioned, the 256GB version of the Air has seven-core graphics, while the 512GB version has eight-core. There's a pretty simple reason for this: with the manufacturing of any silicon, a certain percentage of product won't come up to snuff, probably through defective cores. Those 'bad cores' can then be shut off and the product sold as a different version, hence the seven-core variant.<br><br>

			<img src="6.jpg">
			<br>There's support for the latest Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 6 standards, while the 720p FaceTime HD camera is now enhanced with some smarts from the image signal processor (ISP) on the M1 platform – it's clearly better than in previous generations, as skin tones are better, colours are generally improved and the room looks brighter – but we still feel that Apple should upgrade the camera to a Full HD one.<br>

			Apple Silicon app support and macOS Big Sur<br>
			Support for non-native Apple Silicon apps via Rosetta 2 translator<br>
			All Apple apps are Apple Silicon-ready<br>
			Affinity, Google Chrome, Microsoft Office and other key apps have support<br>
			Others on the way, including full Adobe Creative Cloud compatibility<br>
			The key question with the move to Apple Silicon processors is if Apple could avoid the issues it had when it moved from Power PC to Intel processors around 2005. Could apps really work seamlessly on a completely new processor this time? The short answer is yes, Apple has avoided the major issues.<br><br>

			<img src="7.jpg">
			<br>That's thanks to Rosetta 2, a code translator, helping non-native apps run on Apple Silicon systems. Bizarrely it isn't installed as default – presumably if you just use Apple's own apps you won't need it. But if you open an app that isn't ready for Apple Silicon, you're prompted to install.<br>

			For an ever-increasing number of apps from the Mac App Store and Apple's native apps, everything works fine. But for stuff from other vendors, more work is needed. That work is happening, of course, but if you rely on even a couple of lesser-known apps you may want to wait until you know there is native M1 support. <br>

			Zoom, for example, worked absolutely fine on Rosetta 2. Yet the company has been quick to announce an Apple Silicon version. Native Apple Silicon support doesn't guarantee any problems, however – Google had to work to fix Chrome after the ARM version crashed repeatedly, which was a major pain for us the first few days we used this Mac. Generally though, apps are stable using Rosetta 2.<br><br>

			<img src="8.jpg">
			<br>Apple Silicon-enabled Affinity apps, including Affinity Photo, run brilliantly, as does Microsoft Office (also now updated for Apple Silicon). But other big-vendor apps are lagging behind. Adobe Creative Cloud has yet to fully move across, even if Lightroom already has support.<br>
			Now, if you compare apples with oranges and look at Microsoft's rambling attempts to cater for ARM-based Windows PCs, the Apple Silicon transition is already a dream. The Windows Store is a car crash in comparison to the Mac App Store and, while you can easily live off apps from the Mac App Store, the same can't be said of its Windows equivalent. <br>
			macOS Big Sur is generally very stable providing you're using at least the 11.1 version – the 11.0 version wasn't so hot, with some apps quite slow, a couple of issues with USB-C docks and so on. While the Apple Silicon support is the big story with Big Sur, the design has been overhauled. This isn't the radical change that Apple first billed, but the design is more like iPadOS than ever.<br>

		<h2>iPad mini vs iPad vs iPad Air vs iPad Pro</h2>
		<a href="item2.html"><img src="ipad10.jpg"></a>
		<p>	There may not be as much choice as smartphones when it comes to tablets, but there are still a number of decisions to be made. If you are reading this, it's 		likely you have already decided on iOS, and you are now trying to figure out what size iPad is the right one for you and which one fits into how much you want to 		spend.<br>
			Apple offers a number of iPad options ranging from 7.9-inch displays to 12.9-inches in size. There are also some older models, which although discontinued by Apple, are still available elsewhere, usually at good prices.<br>
			We've therefore included a couple of them in this round-up so you can see the differences between all models available, old and new, to find the most suitable iPad for you.<br>

			<h2>Quick summary</h2>
			iPad (8th generation) offers much the same design as its predecessor. It has support for Apple Pencil, Apple's Smart Keyboard and it is significantly cheaper than the iPad Pro models, as well as cheaper than the iPad Air.<br>
			iPad Air (2020) opts for Touch ID over Face ID like the iPad 8th generation but it moves the fingerprint sensor to the top, reducing the bezels and offering a design more in line with the more expensive Pro models. It is compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, like the iPad (8th gen).<br>
			iPad mini 5 has the same design as the iPad mini 4 but it offers a number of upgrades when it comes to hardware, including processor and front camera. 
			iPad Pro 11 (2020) is one of the most powerful iPads available. It comes with a new design offering super-slim bezels, Face ID and excellent specs. It offers support for the second-gen Apple Pencil and it offers all the latest features in a more compact format than the 12.9 model.<br>
			iPad Pro 12.9 (2020) is the most expensive iPad available, as well as the most powerful alongside the 11-inch model. Launched in March 2020, these are for those that want to treat their tablet more like a computer. It offers the same hardware as the 11-inch model but in a larger size and with a higher price tag.<br>
			iPad Pro 11 (2018) and iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) are the older versions of the iPad Pro. While they've both been replaced, they're still available, and are cheaper than the latest models.<br>
			<img src="ipad11.jpg"><br>
			<h2>Apple iPad (8th generation)</h2>
			Dimensions: 250.6 x 174.1 x 7.5mm, 490g<br>
			Display: 10.2 inches, 2160 x 1620 (264ppi)<br>
			Storage: 32GB, 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold<br>
			The 2020 iPad sticks to much the same design as its predecessor with a larger display 10.2-inch display compared to the iPad 9.7. Touch ID is on board, as it was on the 2019 model, and there is no fully laminated display or anti-reflective coating as there is on the iPad Air - further down this list.<br>

			The processor sees a bump to the A12 Bionic chip compared to the A10 in the 2019 model, and there is support for Apple's Smart Keyboard, like the iPad Air. It is compatible with the first generation of Apple Pencil too, as the older model was.<br>

			There is an 8-megapixel rear camera and 1.2-megapixel front snapper on this iPad, and it comes in silver, gold, and space grey colour options. A few features from the iPad Pro models are lacking, such as ProMotion and True Tone display technologies, as well as the speed increase you'll get from the Pro models and the iPad Air, but the iPad 2020 is a lot cheaper than the Pro models and the Air.<br>

			
			<img src="ipad12.jpg"><br>
			<h2>Apple iPad Air</h2>
			Dimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm, 458g<br>
			Display: 10.9-inches, 2360 x 1640 (264ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Rose Gold, Green, Sky Blue<br>
			The Apple iPad Air sits in between the iPad Pro 11 and the cheaper iPad (8th generation). The design is more in line with the iPad Pro range than its predecessor however, with Touch ID moving to the top, allowing for slimmer bezels around the display.<br>

			There's an A14 Bionic chip under the hood, which is a power boost over the iPad (8th generation) and the iPad Air comes with both Apple Pencil (second gen) and Apple Smart Keyboard support too. The iPad Air's display also sees improvements over the iPad (8th generation), with an anti-reflective coating, True Tone technology and a wider colour gamut, as well as a larger display in a slimmer and lighter build, though it misses out on the ProMotion technology found in the Pro models.<br>

			There is a 12-megapixel rear camera like the iPad Pro, which is a bump up from the iPad (8th gen), though it doesn't have the secondary Ultra-Wide lens that the Pro has. There is a 7-megapixel front camera too though - the same as the Pro.<br>

			There are two speakers like the iPad (8th gen) rather than four like the iPad Pro models, but the iPad Air (2020) has USB Type-C for charging, rather than Lightning like the iPad Pro 11.<br>

			<img src="ipad13.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPad mini 5</h2>
			Dimensions: 203.2 x 134.8 x 6.1mm, 300g<br>
			Display: 7.9-inches, 2048 x 1536 (326ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold<br>
			The Apple iPad mini 5 features the same design as the older iPad mini 4 opting for Touch ID like the iPad Air, rather than Face ID like the newer iPad Pro models. <br>

			There are numerous hardware upgrades over the iPad mini 4 though, with the iPad mini 5 said to be three times faster than its predecessor thanks to the A12 Bionic chip. This is the same processor as the larger iPad (8th gen), but a step down from the iPad Air and iPad Pro 11.<br>

			Like the iPad Air, the iPad mini 5 brings a range of display improvements, including the addition of True Tone technology and it also adds Apple Pencil compatibility - though first gen and not second gen like the Air. It also has the sharpest display of all the iPads available with a 326ppi pixel density.<br>

			Compared to the older iPad mini 4, the iPad mini 5 has an upgraded front camera, moving from 1.2-megapixels to 7-megapixels and offering up to 1080p video compared to 720p. It has up to 256GB of storage and like the iPad 8th gen, it is charged via Lightning.<br>

			<img src="ipad14.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPad Pro 11 (2018) and (2020)</h2>
			Dimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm, 468g<br>
			Display: 11-inches, 2388 x 1668 (264ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB (2018), 128GB (2020), 256GB, 512GB, 1TB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey<br>
			The iPad Pro 11 succeeded the iPad Pro 10.5 with a completely new design in 2018 and was refreshed in 2020 - the older model is still available though. It ditches Touch ID for Face ID and squares off the aluminium edges for a more refined design.<br>

			Apple has included the A12X Bionic processor in the iPad Pro 11, now upgraded to the A12Z, and it also comes in a 1TB storage option while the basic model's storage was also upgraded from 64 to 128GB. There's also a beefed-up camera. <br>

			This tablet is also compatible with the second-generation of the Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically and charges wirelessly. The Lightning connector has been replaced with USB Type-C too for the new iPad Pro, allowing for charging and out, like the latest iPad Air.<br>

			<img src="ipad15.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) and (2020)</h2>


			Dimensions: 280.6 x 214.9 x 5.9mm, 631g<br>
			Display: 12.9-inches, 2732 x 2048 (264ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB (2018), 128GB (2020), 256GB, 512GB, 1TB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey<br>
			Two years ago, the iPad Pro 12.9 delivered a complete design overhaul with slimmer bezels, no Touch ID home button and flatter edges. This new design allows the 12.9 model to reduce in size compared to the old 12.9 model, despite offering the same size display.<br>

			It's now been updated with the A12Z processor and beefy rear cameras. There's also up to 1TB of storage and USB Type-C over Lightning for charging in and out, as well as the same camera capabilities with Face ID.<br>

			The iPad Pro 12.9 is compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil which attaches magnetically to the iPad Pro 12.9 and charges wirelessly when attached. Like the Magic Keyboard, it's still sold separately though, making this one pricey tablet.<br>

			<img src="ipad16.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPad Pro 10.5</h2>

			Dimensions: 250.6 x 174.1 x 6.1mm, 469g<br>
			Display: 10.5-inches, 2224 x 1668 (264ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 256GB, 512GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular)<br>
			Battery: Up to 10 hours<br>
			Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, Rose Gold<br>
			The iPad Pro 10.5 features a 40 per cent reduction in bezels and a 20 per cent increase in display size over the older iPad Pro 9.7, but it has an older design compared to the newer iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9. This older design does mean Touch ID though so if you want a physical fingerprint sensor, this is the iPad Pro for you.<br>

			The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with True Tone technology, a display that offers 600nits of brightness and a technology called ProMotion that allows it to support 120Hz refresh rates is also on board. Under its hood, it has the A10X Fusion processor with embedded M10 motion coprocessor is coupled with a 10 hour battery life, as well as the Smart Connector and four-speaker audio setup.<br>

			It also offers a 12-megapixel rear snapper and a 7-megapixel front camera. Apple Pencil compatibility is on board, but for the first generation not the second like the iPad Air, and it also offers compatibility with the Smart Keyboard, while storage options range from 64GB to 512GB.</p>

		<h2>iPhone SE, XR, iPhone 11, 12 or 12 Pro?</h2>
		<a href="item3.html"><img src="iphone10.jpg"></a>
		<p>
			The smartphone market is as crowded as ever - there's plenty of choice, almost too much in fact. <br>
			If you're reading this feature, you have at least narrowed your options down to Apple's iPhone. Even that isn't totally simple, though, with a range of models to choose from. <br>
			Apple offers the iPhone SE, the iPhone XR, the iPhone 11, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max. With seven options, the big question is which one is the one for you? Let us explain the differences to help you figure out where you should spend your cash.<br>

			<h2>Quick summary</h2>
			The iPhone 12 mini is the base model of the most recent range of iPhones, and the smallest  and lightest in the line up, offering a dual camera, OLED display, aluminium build, five colour options and a processor bump over the older iPhone 11.<br>
			The iPhone 12 offers exactly the same hardware and features as the iPhone 12 mini but on a larger scale, with a 6.1-inch display like the iPhone 12 Pro.<br>
			The iPhone 12 Pro has the same hardware as the iPhone 12 but it offers a more premium build and a triple rear camera with a few extra camera features compared to the iPhone 12 too.<br>
			The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the iPhone that has it all. Its hardware is the same as the iPhone 12 Pro, but it offers a more advanced camera and everything in a larger package with a 6.7-inch OLED display.<br>
			The iPhone 11 offers slightly older hardware to the iPhone 12 mini and 12 along with an LCD display over OLED, but it still comes in a good range of colours, offers water and dust resistance and has a dual camera.<br>
			The iPhone XR is the entry-level model into the Face ID iPhones with an all-screen front design and Face ID over Touch ID. It has the oldest core hardware of all the current phones offered by Apple though and it offers a single camera on the rear.<br>


			<img src="iphone12.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPhone 12 mini</h2>
			Dimensions: 131.5. x 64.2 x 7.4mm, 135g, IP68 water resistant<br>
			Display: 5.4-inch, 2340 x 1080 (476ppi), Haptic Touch, True Tone, HDR<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB<br>
			Battery: Up to 15 hours<br>
			Colours: Black, Green, Blue, White, Product(RED)<br>

			The Apple iPhone 12 mini is the smallest iPhone available - smaller than the iPhone SE (2020) despite offering a larger display. It comes with Face ID like the rest of the iPhone 12 models and it features an aluminium body with squarer edges than the iPhone 11 and a ceramic shield front.<br>
			There is a dual camera on the rear - like the older iPhone 11 and the larger iPhone 12 - and it comes with Night Mode on the front camera, as well as improvements to Night Mode on the rear too. <br>
			Under the hood, the iPhone 12 mini has the A14 chip, which is the same as all the iPhone 12 models. It also has an OLED display with HDR, True Tone and Haptic Touch and it offers MagSafe, though it misses out on a couple of camera features compared to the Pro models, even if the results are still great.<br>
			The iPhone 12 mini is the iPhone to buy if you want some of the latest and greatest features Apple has to offer but in lovely small and light package. <br>

			<img src="iphone13.jpg">
			<h2>Apple iPhone 12</h2>
			Dimensions: 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.4mm, 164g, IP68 water resistant<br>
			Display: 6.1-inch, 2532 x 1170 (460ppi), Haptic Touch, True Tone, HDR<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB<br>
			Battery: Up to 17 hours<br>
			Colours: Blue, Green, White, Black, Product(RED)<br>


			The Apple iPhone 12 offers all the same features and hardware as the iPhone 12 mini, but in a larger package. Rather than a 5.4-inch display, it has a 6.1-inch display, which is the same as the iPhone 12 Pro.<br>
			It has the same aluminium frame, ceramic shield front and it's available in the same five colours as the iPhone 12 mini, whilst also offering the same camera capabilities, with a dual rear camera.<br>
			The iPhone 12 is the iPhone to buy if you want most of the latest features and hardware in a larger package than the 12 mini, but you don't want to pay the extra for the more premium build and additional camera features offered by the iPhone 12 Pro. <br>


			<img src="iphone14.jpg">

			<h2>Apple iPhone 11</h2>
			Dimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mm, 194g, IP68 water resistant<br>
			Display: 6.1-inch, 1792 x 828 (326ppi), Haptic Touch, True Tone, HDR<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 256GB, 512GB<br>
			Battery: Up to 17 hours<br>
			Colours: Black, Green, Yellow, Purple, White, Product(RED)<br>

			The Apple iPhone 11 takes its design ethos from the older iPhone XR, with an aluminium frame and a coloured glass rear.<br>
			There's a dual camera on the rear - like the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 - and it has a few extra camera features compared to the older iPhone XR, including Night Mode and Auto Adjustments, though a few less than the iPhone 12 models.<br>
			The iPhone 11 runs on the A13 chip, and it has a slight battery boost over the older iPhone XR. It offers the same size and resolution display as the iPhone XR however, meaning it sticks with LCD over OLED - and it lacks HDR too. It does have True Tone though, as well as Haptic Touch like the iPhone 12 models.<br>
			The iPhone 11 is the iPhone to buy if you want some great features, a great camera and a powerful phone despite running on last year's hardware, and you don't have the budget for the iPhone 12.<br>

			<h2>Apple iPhone XR</h2>
			Dimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mm, 194g, IP67 water resistant<br>
			Display: 6.1-inch, 1792 x 828 (326ppi), True Tone<br>
			Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB<br>
			Battery: Up to 25 hours<br>
			Colours: White, Black, Blue, Yellow, Coral, (PRODUCT)RED<br>

			The iPhone XR is the cheapest way to get your hands on the latest iPhone design with the full-screen front, no Touch ID home button and Face ID, sitting between the iPhone SE and the iPhone 11 in terms of price. The XR has a glass back with IP67 water and dust resistance and it comes in six colour options.<br>
			The display size increases from the iPhone SE to 6.1-inches but the footprint of the XR makes it slightly larger than the iPhone SE. It's an LCD display that offers Haptic Touch. It also has True Tone technology.<br>
			The iPhone XR runs on Apple's A12 Bionic chip and its battery life is good, longer than the iPhone SE. It supports wireless charging and fast charging, but it doesn't have a fast charger in the box.<br>
			A single-camera is present on the back of the iPhone XR, differentiating it from the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12. It's a 12-megapixel wide-angle sensor with OIS, but despite not offering the secondary telephoto sensor, the iPhone XR still has Portrait Mode with Depth Control, Smart HDR and Portrait Lighting features like the iPhone 11.<br>
			The iPhone XR is the iPhone to buy if you want a Face ID iPhone but aren't that fussed about the dual camera of the iPhone 11. <br>
